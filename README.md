Run TwistCalculator.py to get twist results. 

To use, follow the screeen prompts. Drag and drop green and sintered files into the window to get file locations of the results. 

Green and sintered data must be in seperate files and the samples must have the same numbering. (ie, beta0 is sample 1 in green and sample 1 in sintered.) 

Multiple measurements for samples should be done. Samples and runs will be labeled "[sample][run]". So beta0 runs will look like 10, 11, 12 whereas alpha0 runs will look like 20, 21, 22 (alpha0 being sample 2). 

Examples of green and sintered results are under ../Results

As of now, you need to tell the program what sample you want to calculate and do each sample one at a time. Copy down the average twist (average of the 4 sides) into a results document.
